What was cWas this process challenging for you? 
It was challenging using the vertex because I wasn't familiar with vertex that much, so I found some lessons on YouTube to help me, and I tried the method that I learned but failed. I thought it was because of the size of the background so I adjusted my sketch and make it smaller. But that didn't work either, finally, I figured out that it was because of the vertexes. 
What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
I know why we need an endshape at the end and a starshape at the beginning because these two things help the system to know when to begin and when to end. 
What are you proud of?
I am proud of myself for figuring out how the vertex works in Editor it took me an hour to do that and took and another thirty minutes to finish the whole assignment I didn't notice that the time was passing, and I was thrilled after I finished the assignment.
